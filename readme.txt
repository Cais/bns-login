== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I get support for this plugin? =
Please note, support may be available on the WordPress Support forums; but, it may be faster to visit http://buynowshop.com/plugins/bns-login/ and leave a comment with the issue you are experiencing.

= Is it really that simple? =
Yes, it really is.

= Can the plugin be styled? =
Yes, the plugin text is wrapped in its own `<div id="bns-logged-in" class="bns-login">` or `<div id="bns-logged-out" class="bns-login">` depending on the login status of the user.

Copy the contents of the included `bns-login-style.css` file (which contains a framework of the CSS elements generated by the plugin); and paste them into a new stylesheet `bns-login-custom-style.css`. This file should not get over-written with future updates so your specific CSS will remain.

1. Logged in text.
2. Logged out text.
